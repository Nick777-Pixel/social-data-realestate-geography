# Arup Eviction Data
This is a repository for analysis on open data related to evictions as a result of COVID-19. This repository gathers data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data portal (FRED). There are a number of potential use cases we're aware of to apply that data to address evictions. 

The analysis we do now allows us compare counties side by side by their "Relative Risk" of evictions.

## Usage
This repository currently supports three primary workflows:

1. Gathering data for a single county in a state
2. Gathering and comparing data for multiple counties using a Relative Risk index
3. Gathering data for all counties in a state and comparing using a Relative Risk index

These workflows support a number of use cases, including:
- Providing direct assistance to families in one or more counties
- Driving decisions around future affordable housing projects
- Directing policy response on the city or county level

There are two ways to interact with this data.
- Python scripts - Include functions to gather, clean, and analyze data to output a relative risk ranking for multiple counties. Can be extended with your own scripts. 
- Custom SQL Queries - SQL that you write to get the most recent data from our database and use however you want. 

### About the data
This data is the most recent data we could get, but some datasets are updated more frequently than others. You can see the date that the data was updated in `all_tables.xlsx`. We refresh the data monthly on the first of the month. All datasets are at the county level. The following datasets are currently in the database:

| Burdened Households (%) | [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) | 1/1/2018 | People who pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent |

| Median Rents | [HUD](https://www.huduser.gov/PORTAL/datasets/50per.html) | 2021 | Rent estimates at the 50th percentile (or median)  calculated for all Fair Market Rent areas|
| Housing Stock Distributions | [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206393/distribution-of-housing-units-in-the-us-by-number-of-bedrooms/) | 2017 | Distribution of housing units in the US by number of bedrooms|

### What is Relative Risk?
Relative risk is an index used to compare counties against each other in our Python analysis. It is _not_ a measure of absolute or percentage risk and has no meaning outside of this analysis. We use this compare counties to understand where people are more at risk of eviction. 

We calculate this using a custom formula to balance socioeconomic factors with the policy response of a city. There are three parts of this formula: a socioeconomic value from FRED and other data sources, a policy value found using the policy Excel sheet in this repository, and the time remaining until protections end. The equation is

`relative_risk = socioeconomic_index * (1 - policy_index) / sqrt(time_remaining)`

In this equation, we aim to minimize socioeconomic risk on the top of the fraction, maximize the policy response value and take 1 minus the index value calculated (to represent that better policy constitutes less relative risk), and maximize the time remaining on the bottom of the fraction. The square root of the time remaining is used to represent how additional time has diminishing returns. For example, the different between having 2 days and 2 weeks until protections expire is much different than whether policies expire in 3 months or 4 months when we think about how to prioritize one county over another.   

## What is cost of evictions?

To calculate the cost to avoid evictions the following calcuation was used:

    `(burdened household proportion/100) * county rent * housing stock distribution percentage * population * (burdened households/100)`

Housing stock distributions (statista) were used to evaluate the types of houses that exist in the United States (e.g. studio, one bedroom, etc.).  Burdened household proportions were decided by Arup and were used to determine what percentage of people were most at risk.  Proportions were set at 5, 25, 33, 50, and 75 (why?).  County rents for each housing stock were sourced from HUD, and used Fair Market Rates to determine rent prices for each stock.  Fair Market Rents (FMRs) represent the estimated amount (base rent + essential utilities) that a property in a given area typically rents for. Burdened households was a percentage calculated by (source?) which gives the percentage of the population at risk of not paying their rent that month (?).  Population data was pulled from HUD and represents the population by county in the year 2017. 

Performing this calculation for each proportion and each housing stock will calculate the amount needed to prevent eviction for each proportion.  The total cost of evictions for a particular county for one month was calcuated by summing each housing stock.  To get the cost of prevention for more than one month, the sum was multiplied by the number of months of interest.  

Upon script completion, an sheet will be created within the output excel file displaying all values mentioned above in an easy to follow table format.  If you experience problems with the script or have questions about methodologies, please reach out to a member of the development team.  

## Python Users
We've done our previous analyses in Python, and have built data gathering, cleaning, and analysis functions.

### Install
In a virtual environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run
To run the main script, run:

`python run.py`

The `credentials.py` file is configured to allow read-only access to an Arup-maintained database of the most recent relevant FRED data. In addition to using these Python scripts, you can connect to this database and run direct SQL queries to get the data you want.

### FRED Queries
You can get the most recent Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) using the following commands:

`python -m queries`

#### Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--table`| Specifies a table that you want to query. If none is given, will return all tables.|
| `--ouput`| Specifies an output type, without a ".". Currently, only `pk` or `xlsx` are supported. `pk` returns a pickled `pandas.DataFrame`. If none is given, will default to `xlsx`.|

#### Purpose

This command will query the eviction data database, and return data in an `Output` folder. If no folder exists, will be created by the `queries.py` script.

## Database Users
The database that this repository uses is open for *read-only* access. The connection details are stored in `credentials.py` if you're using the Python workflow.

If you'd like to query the database directly using the method of your choice, you can access it using the credentials below:

```
DB_HOST = ade-eviction.ccgup3bgyakw.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_NAME = eviction_data

### Issues
Please post bugs, errors, and questions to the Issues tab of this repository.

### Code
Make a pull request with your feature or bug fixes and we will review it. You're free to merge once it's been approved.

### Policy Data
Policy data is some of the most useful, but also the hardest to get. We've shared policies for a number of counties we've analyzed in the Bay Area and Tulsa area. We hope that as you do policy analysis for your area, you'll contribute that back so others can use and verify it. 

For now, to submit your data, open an issue in this repository and submit your policy data (countdown and/or policy ranking) for the county or counties you're looking at. 

### Other Data Sources
If there are data sources you'd like to see included in this, please reach out through the Issues tab. We are aware of a few blind spots in our current data, including the existing state of homelessness in a county and the county demographics. We are also interested in getting data beyond the county level.
